# 20 - solution

- The sentences 1,2 have the forms:
  - not(A or B),
  - (not A) and (not B).
- The first says: it is false that either of A or B is true.
- If it has been established that neither A nor B is true,
- then it must follow that both A is not true and B is not true.
- If either A or B were true, then the disjunction of A and B would be true,
- making its negation false.
- Presented in English, this follows the logic that
- "since two things are both false, it is also false that either of them is true".

- The sentences 3,4 have the forms:
  - not(A and B),
  - (not A) or (not B).
- The first says: it is false that A and B are both true.
- If it has been established that A and B are not both true,
- then it must follow that either or both of A or B must be false,
- for if they both were true, then the conjunction of A and B would be true,
- making its negation false.
- Thus, (at least) one or more of A and B must be false,
  - (or equivalently, one or more of "not A" and "not B" must be true.)
- Presented in a natural language like English, it is expressed as
- "since it is false that two things are both true, at least one of them must be false".

- The sentences 5,6 have the forms:
  - (not A) and (not B),
  - not(A or B).
- This is the same situation as sentences 1,2 but the order is reversed.
- The first form asserts that A is false and B is false,
  - (or equivalently that "not A" and "not B" are true.)
- Knowing this, a disjunction of A and B must be false also.
- The negation of said disjunction must thus be true,
- and the result is identical to the second form.

- The sentences 7,8 have the forms:
  - (not A) or (not B),
  - not(A and B).
- This is the same situation as sentences 3,4 but the order is reversed.
- The first asserts that at least one of "not A" and "not B" must be true,
  - (or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false).
- Since at least one of them must be false,
- then their conjunction would likewise be false.
- Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression,
- and this expression is identical to the second form.
- Presented in a natural language like English, it is expressed as
- "since at least one of two things must be false, it is false that they are both true".
