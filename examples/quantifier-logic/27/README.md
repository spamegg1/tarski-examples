# 27 - Numerical sentences

By a “numerical claim” we mean one that says that there are
a certain number of objects, or a certain number with some property or other.
In earlier examples, we have already come across some simple numerical claims.
This example will help you recognize numerical claims when you
come across them in our first-order language.

- Open Whitehead’s Sentences.

1. The first sentence says that there are at least two objects, and the
second sentence says that there are at most two objects. (Do you
see how they manage to say these things?) Build a world where the
first two sentences are both true.
2. Sentence 3 is the conjunction of the first two. Hence it asserts, in
one sentence, that there are exactly two objects. Check to see that
it is true in the world you have just built.
3. The fourth sentence is in fact equivalent to the third sentence. It is
a shorter way of saying that there are exactly two objects. Use the
game to see why it is true in a world where there are two objects,
but false in worlds with more or less than two objects.
4. Sentence 5 appears, at first sight, to assert that there are at least
three objects, so it should be false in a world with two objects.
Check to see if it is indeed false in such a world. Why isn’t it? Play
the game to confirm your suspicions.
5. The sixth sentence actually manages to express the claim that there
are at least three objects. Do you see how it’s different from the
fifth sentence? Check to see that it is false in the current world,
but is true if you add another object to the world.
6. The seventh sentence says that there are exactly three objects in the
world. Check to see that it is true in the world with three objects,
but false if you either delete an object or add another object.
7. Sentence 8 asserts that a is a large object, and in fact the only large
object. To see just how the sentence manages to say this, start with
a world with three small objects and name one of them a. Play the
game committed to true to see why the sentence is false. Now make
object a large. Play the game committed to false to see why it is
true. Finally, make one of the other objects large as well, and play
the game committed to true to see why it is false.
8. Sentence 8 asserted that a was the only large object. How might we
say that there is exactly one large object, without using a name for
the object? Compare sentence 8 with sentence 9. The latter asserts
that there is something which is the only large object. Check to
see that it is true only in worlds in which there is exactly one large
object.
9. Construct a world in which sentence 10 is true. Save your world as World 3.27.1.
10. Make sentences 11 and 12 true in a single world. Save your world as World 3.27.2.
11. Sentence 13 is another way to assert that there is a unique circle.
That is, sentence 13 is equivalent to sentence 10. Can you see why?
Check three worlds to see that the two sentences are true
in the same worlds—those in which there is a single circle.
12. Sentence 14 says that there are exactly two tetrahedra. Check that
it is true in such worlds, but false if there are fewer or more than two.
