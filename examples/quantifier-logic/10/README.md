# 10 (Translating existential noun phrases)

The first thing you have to learn in order to translate quantified expressions
is how to treat complex noun phrases, expressions like
“some boy living in Omaha” or “every girl living in Duluth.”

In this example we will concentrate on the former sort of noun phrase,
those whose most natural translation involves an existential quantifier.
Typically, these will be noun phrases starting with one of the determiners
“some,” “a,” and “an,” including noun phrases like “something.”.

- Start a new sentence file and enter translations of the following English sentences.
- Each will use the symbol ∃ exactly once.
- None will use the symbol ∀.
- As you go, check that your entries are well-formed sentences.
- By the way, you will find that many of these English sentences
  are translated using the same first-order sentence.

1. Something is large.
2. Something is a square.
3. Something is a large square.
4. Some square is large.
  [Hint: This sentence means the same thing as: Something is both a square and large.]
5. Some large square is to the left of b.
6. A large square is to the left of b.
7. b has a large square to its left.
8. b is to the right of a large square.
  [Hint: This translation should be almost the same as the last,
  but it should contain the predicate symbol RightOf.]
9. Something to the left of b is in back of c.
10. A large square to the left of b is in back of c.
11. Some large square is to the left of b and in back of c.
12. Some circle is not large.
13. Something is not a large circle.
14. It is not the case that something is a large circle.
15. b is not to the left of a square.
  [Warning: This sentence is ambiguous.
  Can you think of two importantly different translations?
  One starts with ∃, the other starts with ¬.
  Use the second of these for your translation,
  since this is the most natural reading of the English sentence.]

- Save your list of sentences as Sentences 3.10.
- Open Montague’s World.
- Notice that all the English sentences above are true in this world.
- Check that all your translations are also true.
- If not, you have made a mistake.
- Can you figure out what is wrong with your translation?
- Move the large square to the back right corner of the grid.
- Observe that English sentences 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 15 are now false,
- while the rest are still true.
- Check that the same holds of your translations.
- If not, you have made a mistake.
- Can you figure out what is wrong with your translation?
- Now make the large square small.
- The English sentences 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15 are false in the modified world,
- the rest are true.
- Again, check that your translations have the same truth values.
- If not, figure out what is wrong.
- Finally, move c straight back to the back row, and make b large.
- All the English sentences other than 1, 2, and 13 are false.
- Check that the same holds for your translations.
- If not, figure out where you have gone wrong.
