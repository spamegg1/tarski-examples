# 16 - Building a world

- Open `RamseySentences1` in the empty `worldQ16` by running `runQ16`.
- Build a world in which sentences 1–10 are all true at once.
- These sentences all make either
  - "particular" claims (that is, they contain no quantifiers), or
  - "existential" claims (that is, they assert that things of a certain sort exist).
- Consequently, you could make them true by successively adding objects to the world.
- But part of the example is to make them all true with as few objects as possible.
- You should be able to do it with seven objects, total.
- So rather than adding objects for each new sentence,
  try adjusting the world, and only add new objects when necessary.
- Be sure to go back and check that all the sentences are true when you are finished.
- After you're done with the world, you can take a screenshot of the world,
  and add the blocks to `worldQ16`.
- Save `worldQ16` and `runQ16` again to make sure you transcribed the blocks correctly.
