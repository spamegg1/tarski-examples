# 37 - Translation

- Open Peirce’s World.
- Look at it in 2-D to remind yourself of the hidden objects.
- Start a new sentence file where you will translate the following English sentences.
- Again, be sure to check each to see that it is indeed a true sentence.

1. Everything is either a cube or a triangle.
2. Every cube is to the left of every triangle.
3. There are at least three triangles.
4. Every small cube is in back of a particular big cube.
5. Every triangle is small.
6. Every circle is smaller than some triangle. [Note: This is
  vacuously true in this world.]

- Now let’s change the world so that none of the English sentences are true.
- (We can do this by changing the big cube in front to a circle,
- the big cube in back to a triangle,
- and deleting the two small triangles in the far right column.)
- If your answers to 1–5 are correct,
- all of your translations should be false as well.
- If not, you have made a mistake in translation.
- Make further changes, and check to see that the
- truth values of your translations track those of the English sentences.
- Submit your sentence file.
