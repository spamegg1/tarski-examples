# 15 - Figuring out sizes, shapes and tones

Start a new sentence file and use it to translate the following English sentences.

1. If a is a triangle, then b is also a triangle.
2. c is a triangle if b is.
3. a and c are both tetrahedra only if at least one of them is large.
4. a is a triangle but c isn’t large.
5. If c is small and d is a circle, then d is neither large nor small.
6. c is medium only if none of d, e, and f are squares.
7. d is a small circle unless a is small.
8. e is large just in case it is a fact that d is large if and only if f is.
9. d and e are the same size.
10. d and e are the same shape.
11. f is either a square or a circle, if it is large.
12. c is larger than e only if b is larger than c.
13. c and f have the same tone and a has a different tone than b.
14. If d has tone lime, then e has tone red.
15. a and e have the same tone if and only if d and b do.

- Save these sentences as `sentences15`.
- Then see if you can figure out the sizes, shapes and tones of a, b, c, d, e, f.
- You will find it helpful to approach this problem systematically,
  filling in the following table as you reason about the sentences:

|     | a | b | c | d | e | f |
|:----|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Shape|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Size |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Tone |   |   |   |   |   |   |

- When you have filled in the table, use it to guide you in building a
  world `grid15` in which the twelve English sentences are true.
- Verify that your translations are true in this world as well.
