# 38 - More translations for practice

This exercise is just to give you more practice translating sentences of various sorts.
They are all true in Skolem’s World, in case you want to look while translating.
Translate the following sentences.

1. Not every cube is smaller than every tetrahedra.
2. No cube is to the right of anything.
3. There is a dodecahedron unless there are at least two large objects.
4. No cube with nothing in back of it is smaller than another cube.
5. If any dodecahedra are small, then they are between two cubes.
6. If a cube is medium or is in back of something medium, then it
  has nothing to its right except for tetrahedra.
7. The further back a thing is, the larger it is.
8. Everything is the same size as something else.
9. Every cube has a tetrahedron of the same size to its right.
10. Nothing is the same size as two (or more) other things.
11. Nothing is between objects of shapes other than its own.

- Open Skolem’s World.
- Notice that all of the above English sentences are true.
- Verify that the same holds of your translations.
- This time, rather than open other worlds, make changes to Skolem’s World
- and see that the truth value of your translations track that of the English sentence.
- For example, consider sentence 5.
- Add a small dodecahedron between the front two cubes.
- The English sentence is still true.
- Is your translation?
- Now move the dodecahedron over between two tetrahedra.
- The English sentence is false.
- Is your translation?
- Now make the dodecahedron medium.
- The English sentence is again true.
- How about your translation?
- Submit your sentence file.
