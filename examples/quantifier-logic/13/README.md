# 13 - Translation

- Open Leibniz’s World.
- This time, we will translate some sentences while looking
  at the world they are meant to describe.
- Start a new sentence file, and
- enter translations of the following sentences.
- Each of the English sentences is true in this world.
- As you go, check to make sure that your translation is indeed a true sentence.

1. There are no medium-sized squares.
2. Nothing is in front of b.
3. Every square is either in front of or in back of e.
4. No square is between a and c.
5. Everything is in the same column as a, b, or c.

- Now let’s change the world so that none of the English sentences is true.
- We can do this as follows. First change b into a medium square.
- Next, delete the leftmost triangle and move b
- to exactly the position just vacated by the late triangle.
- Finally, add a small square to the world,
- locating it exactly where b used to sit.
- If your answers to 1–5 are correct, all of the translations should now be false.
- Verify that they are.
- Make various changes to the world,
- so that some of the English sentences come out true and some come out false.
- Then check to see that the truth values of your translations
- track the truth values of the English sentences.

So far, most of the sentences we have looked at have had at most
one quantifier. In the next few examples, we delve into sentences that
contain more than one instance of ∀, or more than one instance of ∃.
