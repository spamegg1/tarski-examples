# 17 - Modifying the world

- `RamseySentences2` all make "universal" claims (except one).
- That is, they all say that every object in the world has some property or other.
- We start with `worldQ16` from the solution of the previous example.
  The blocks from `worldQ16` are copied into `worldQ17` for convenience.
- Check to see whether this world from the previous example
  satisfies the universal claims expressed by these sentences.
- If not, modify it so it makes all 20 sentences true at once
  (meaning, both `RamseySentences1` and `RamseySentences2`).
- Save the modified world `worldQ17` (take a screenshot first if needed).
