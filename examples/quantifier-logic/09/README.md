# 09 - Describing a world

- Open `ReichenbachWorld1`.
- Start a new sentence file where you will describe some features of this
  world using sentences of the simple Aristotelian forms.
- Check each of your sentences to see that it is indeed
  a sentence and is true in this world.

1. Use your first sentence to describe the size of all the triangles.
2. Use your second sentence to describe the size of all the squares.
3. Express the fact that no square is large.
4. Notice that some circle is large. Express this fact.
5. Notice that some circle is neither large nor small. Express this.
6. Observe that some circle is not small. Express this.
7. Notice that some circle is small. Express this fact.
8. Observe that some circle is not large. Express this.
9. Express the observation that no triangle is large.
10. Use your last sentence to express the truism that
  every circle is either small, medium, or large.

- Save your list of sentences as `sentencesQ09`.
- Now change the sizes of the objects in the following way:
  - make one of the squares large,
  - one of the triangles medium, and
  - all the circles small.
- With these changes, the following should come out false:
  - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- If not, then you have made an error in describing the original world.
- Can you figure out what it is?
- Try making other changes and see if your sentences have the expected truth values.
