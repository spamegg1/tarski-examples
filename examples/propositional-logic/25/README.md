# 25 - Elimination of ∧

This is similar to example 24.

Each of the sentences in `GentzenSentences2` (same as `GentzenSentences1`)
involve the use of both ∧ and ∨.
In each even numbered position write a sentence equivalent to the one above it,
but that uses only ∨ and ¬.
Check that the truth values of the pairs of sentences agree in a number of worlds.
