# 05 - Name that object

- Open `MaigretWorld` and `MaigretSentences` by running `runQ05`.
- The goal is to try to figure out which 6 of 8 objects have names, and what they are.
- You should be able to figure this out from the sentences, all of which are true.
- Once you have come to your conclusion, assign the six names to objects in
  the world in such a way that all the sentences do indeed evaluate as true.
