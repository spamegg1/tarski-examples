# 03 - Fixing some expressions

- See `BernsteinSentences`.
- The expressions in this list are not quite well-formed sentences of our language,
  but they can all be made sentences by slight modification.
- Try running `runQ03`.
- At first, it will crash immediately, due to syntax errors in some of the expressions.
- First, fix these syntax errors, so that it can at least run without a crash.
- Now that it's running, evaluate the expressions.
- Notice that some of them will return errors.
- Turn them into sentences *without adding or deleting any quantifier symbols*.
- With some of them, there is more than one way to make them a sentence.
- Run `runQ03` and evaluate to make sure your results are sentences.
  - The truth values are not important.
- Save the corrected sentences.
