# 18 - Expanding a world

- In the real world, things change in various ways.
- They come, move around, and go.
- And as things change, so do the truth values of sentences.
- In this example, the goal is to change World 3.17 to make
  as many of Ramsey’s sentences false as you can.
- But here’s the catch: you can only add objects of various sizes and shapes;
- don’t change the existing objects in any way.
- Save your world as World 3.18.
- Do you notice anything about which sentences you can make
  false in this way and which you cannot?
- Try to give a fairly clear and intuitive account of which
  sentences you cannot make false in this way.
