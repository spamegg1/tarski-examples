# 36 - Saying more complicated things

- Open Skolem’s World.
- Create a new sentence file and describe the following features of Skolem’s World.

1. Use your first sentence to say that there are only cubes and triangles.
2. Next say that there are exactly three cubes.
3. Express the fact that every cube has a triangle that is to its
  right but is neither in front of or in back of it.
4. Express the fact that at least one of the triangles is between two other triangles.
5. Notice that the further back something is, the larger it is. Say this.
6. Note that none of the cubes is to the right of any of the other cubes. Try to say this.
7. Observe that the small triangle is in front of but to neither side
  of all the other triangles. State this.

- Save your list of sentences as Sentences 3.36.
- If you have expressed yourself correctly,
- there is very little you can do to Skolem’s World
- without making at least one of your sentences false.
- Basically, all you can do is “stretch” things out, that is,
- move things apart while keeping them aligned.
- To see this, try making the following changes.

1. Add a new triangle to the world. Find one of your sentences
  that comes out false. Move the new triangle so that a different
  sentence comes out false.
2. Change the size of one of the objects. What sentence now comes out false?
3. Change the shape of one of the objects. What sentence comes out false?
4. Slide one of the cubes to the left. What sentence comes out false?
5. Rearrange the three cubes. What goes wrong now?
