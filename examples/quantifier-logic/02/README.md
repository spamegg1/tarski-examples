# 02 - Building a world

- Open `AristotleSentences` in an empty world by running `runq02`.
- Each of these sentences is of one of the four forms treated in Aristotle's logic:
  - All A's are B's
  - No A's are B's
  - Some A's are B's
  - Some A's are not B's
- Build a single world where all the sentences in the file are true.
- As you work through the sentences, you will find yourself successively
  modifying the world.
- Whenever you make a change in the world, you had better go back
  and check that you haven't made any of the earlier sentences false.
- Then, when you are finished, verify that all the sentences are really true.
- Save your world by first taking a screenshot of the blocks you placed,
  then typing them into `worldQ02` by looking at the screenshot.
  - Remember that rows and columns are 0-indexed!
- Then run the world one more time, with your blocks, to make sure they are correct.
