# 19 - Simple multiple quantifier sentences

The file Frege’s Sentences contains 14 sentences; the first seven begin with a
pair of existential quantifiers, the second seven with a pair of universal quantifiers.
Go through the sentences one by one, evaluating
them in Peirce’s World. Though you probably won’t have any trouble

understanding these sentences, don’t forget to use the game if you do.
When you understand all the sentences, modify the size and location of
a single block so that the first seven sentences are true and the second
seven false. Submit the resulting world.
Now that you have plenty of experience with quantifiers, we present
exercises in which both universal and existential quantifiers get mixed
together.
