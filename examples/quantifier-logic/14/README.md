# 14 - Vacuously true generalizations

- Open Dodgson’s Sentences.
- Note that the first sentence says that every triangle is large.

1. Open Peano’s World. Sentence 1 is clearly false in this world, since
the small triangle is a “counterexample” to the universal claim.
What this means is that if you play the game committed to the
falsity of this claim, then when Tarski’s World asks you to pick an
object you will be able to pick the small triangle and win the
game. Try this.
2. Delete this counterexample and verify that sentence 1 is now true.
3. Now open Peirce’s World. Verify that sentence 1 is again false, this
time because there are three counterexamples. (Now if you play the
game committed to the falsity of the sentence, you will have three
different winning moves when asked to pick an object: you can pick
any of the small tetrahedra and win.)
4. Delete all three counterexamples, and evaluate the claim. Is the result
what you expected? The generalization is true, because there
are no counterexamples to it. But it is what we call a vacuously true
generalization, since there are no objects that satisfy the antecedent.
That is, there are no tetrahedra at all, small, medium, or large.
5. Confirm that all of sentences 1–3 are vacuously true in the current world.
6. Two more vacuously true sentences are given in sentences 4 and 5.
However, these sentences are different in another respect. Each of
the first three sentences could have been non-vacuously true in a
world, but these latter two can only be true in worlds containing no
tetrahedra. That is, the only way they can be true is to be vacuously true.
Let’s call generalizations with this property “inherently vacuous.”
Thus a sentence of the form ∀x (A(x) → B(x)) is inherently vacuous
if any world in which it is true is also a world in which ∀x ¬A(x) is true.
7. Add a sixth generalization to the file that is vacuously true in Peirce’s
World but non-vacuously true in Peano’s World. (In both cases, make
sure you use the unmodified worlds.) Save your new sentence file as Sentences 3.14.

In everyday conversation, it is rare to encounter a vacuously true generalization.
When we do, we feel that the speaker has misled us. For
example, suppose a professor claims “Every freshman who took the
class got an A,” when in fact no freshman took her class. Here we
wouldn’t say that she lied, but we would certainly say that she misled
us. Her claim suggests that there were freshman in the class, and if
there were no freshman, then that’s what she would have said if she
were being forthright. This is why inherently vacuous claims like sentence
5 strike us as counterintuitive: we can see that they cannot be
true without being misleading.
