# 50 Redundancy of Quantifiers 1

Just as there is a redundancy in the collection of propositional connectives
that we have introduced (see examples 2.18, 2.24 and 2.25)
we only need one of the quantifiers, as demonstrated by the following equivalences.

∃xP(x) ⇔ ¬∀x¬P(x)
∀xP(x) ⇔ ¬∃x¬P(x)

The file Barwise’s Sentences contains sentences involving both quantifiers
in the odd numbered positions. In each even numbered position write a sentence
that is equivalent to the one above, but which does not use the existential
quantifier. Simplify your answer by eliminating double negations where possible.
