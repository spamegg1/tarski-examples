# 44 - Evaluating sentences in a world

- Open Leibniz’s World and Zorn’s Sentences.
- The sentences in this file contain both quantifiers and the identity symbol.
- Work through them, assessing their truth and playing the game when necessary.
- After you’re sure you understand why the sentences get the values they do,
- modify the false ones to make them true.
- You can make any change you want except adding or deleting a negation sign.
