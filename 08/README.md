# 08 - doing

- Run `run08` to notice that all of the English sentences from the previous example
  are true in `WittgensteinWorld`.
- Thus, if your translations are accurate, they will also be true in this world.
- Check to see that they are.
- If you made any mistakes, go back and fix them.
- But as we have stressed, even if one of your sentences comes out true in
  Wittgenstein’s World, it does not mean that it is a proper translation of the
  corresponding English sentence. All you know for sure is that your translation and the
  original sentence have the same truth value in this particular world. If the
  translation is correct, it will have the same truth value as the English sentence in
  every world. Thus, to have a better test of your translations, we will examine them in
  a number of worlds, to see if they have the same truth values as their English
  counterparts in all of these worlds.

Let’s start by making modifications to Wittgenstein’s World.
Make all the large or medium objects small, and the small objects large.
With these changes in the world,
the English sentences 1, 3, 4, and 10 become false,
while the rest remain true.
Verify that the same holds for your translations.
If not, correct your translations.
Next, rotate your modified Wittgenstein’s World 90◦ clockwise. Now sentences 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11 should be the only true ones that remain.

Let’s check your translations in another world. Open Boole’s World. The only English sentences that are true in this world are sentences 6 and 11. Verify that all of your translations except 6 and 11 are false. If not, correct your translations.

Now modify Boole’s World by exchanging the positions of b and c. With this change, the English sentences 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11 come out true, while the rest are false. Check that the same is true of your translations.

The remaining exercises of this chapter use the full set of propositional connectives, including → and ↔. If you do not know what these symbols mean, read Section A.5, page 92.
