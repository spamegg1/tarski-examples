# 35 - Definite descriptions and numerical quantifiers

In this example we will try our hand translating English sentences
involving numerical claims and definite descriptions.
For purposes of this example, we will assume that the Russellian
analysis of definite descriptions, described in Exercise 3.28, page 38, is correct.
Translate the following English sentences.

1. There are at least two circles.
2. There are at most two triangles.
3. There are exactly two cubes.
4. There are only three things that are not small.
5. The small triangle has nothing in front of it.
6. The triangle with something in front of it is big.
7. No circle is in back of the big cube.
8. (??) The medium cube is to the right of the big cube.
9. (??) The only thing with nothing to its right is the medium cube.
10. (??) The smallest cube is medium.
