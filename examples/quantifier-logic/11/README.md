# 11 - Common mistakes, part 2

- In this example we return to the point made in example q06.
- Glance back at that example to recall the basic point.
- Now open Allan’s Sentences.
- In this file, sentences 1 and 4 are the correct translations of
  - Some circle is large
  - All triangles are small.
- Let’s investigate the logical relations between these and sentences 2 and 3.

1. Construct a world in which sentences 2 and 4 are true, but sentences
  1 and 3 are false. Save it as World 3.11.1. This shows that sentence 1
  is not a consequence of 2, and sentence 3 is not a consequence of 4.

2. Can you construct a world in which sentence 3 is true and sentence
  4 is false? If so, do so and save it as World 3.11.2. If not, explain why
  you can’t and what this shows.

3. Can you construct a world in which sentence 1 is true and sentence
  2 is false? If so, do so and save it as World 3.11.3. If not, explain why not.

Submit any world files you constructed and turn in any explanations to your instructor.
