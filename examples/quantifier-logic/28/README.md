# 28 - The Russellian analysis of definite descriptions

First-order logic has only two quantifiers, whereas English has many
determiners, words like “some” and “every,” that combine with nouns
to produce noun phrases (like “some cube,” “every cube”).
Other determiners include numbers (as in “two cubes”) and the definite article
“the” (as in “the cube”). Bertrand Russell proposed that a sentence
like The cube is small should be analyzed as asserting that there is
exactly one cube, and it is small. According to this analysis,
the sentence will be false if there is no cube, or if there is more than one, or if
there is exactly one, but it’s not small. If this analysis is correct (and
many do not think it is), then such sentences can easily be expressed
in first-order logic.

1. In example 3.27 on page 36 we saw two ways for saying that there
is a single circle (sentences 10 and 13). Open Russell’s Sentences,
the first sentence here uses the second method for asserting
that there is a single cube. Compare sentence 1 with sentence 2.
Sentence 2 is the Russellian analysis of our sentence The cube is small.
Construct a world in which sentence 2 is true.
2. Construct a world in which sentences 2-7 are all true. (Sentence 7
contains the Russellian analysis of The small circle is to the
left of the medium circle.)
Submit your world.
