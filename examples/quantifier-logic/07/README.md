# 07 - Fixing ungrammatical expressions

- Look at `BozoSentences1`. If you try to run `runQ07`, it will crash.
- Some of the expressions are not wffs,
  - some are wffs but not sentences,
  - and one is a sentence but false.
- Read and assess each one.
- See if you can adjust each one to make it a true sentence
  (in `LeibnizWorld`) with as little change as possible.
- Try to capture the intent of the original expression,
  if you can tell what that was (if not, don't worry).
- Evaluate to make sure your results are true sentences and then save your sentences.
