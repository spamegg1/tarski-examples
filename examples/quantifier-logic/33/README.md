# 33 - More sentences that need paraphrasing before translation

Translate the following sentences by first giving a suitable English paraphrase.

1. Every circle is as big as every cube. [Hint: Since we do not
have anything corresponding to as big as (by which we mean at
least as big as) in our language, you will first need to paraphrase
this predicate using bigger than or same size as.]
2. If a cube is to the right of a circle but not above it, then
it is as big as the circle.
3. No cube with nothing to its left is between two cubes.
4. The only big cubes are b and c.
5. At most b and c are big cubes. [Note: There is a significant differ-
ence between this sentence and the previous one. This one does not
imply that b and c are big cubes, while the previous sentence does.]
