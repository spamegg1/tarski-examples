# 08 - Verifying translations

1. Run `run08a` to notice that all of the English sentences from
  the previous example are true in `WittgensteinWorld`.
2. Thus, if your translations are accurate, they will also be true in this world.
3. Check to see that they are.
4. If you made any mistakes, go back and fix them.
    Now your translations are the same as the English sentences, in ONE world only.
    They might still be different in other worlds.
    Let's test them in another world.
5. Let’s start by making modifications to Wittgenstein’s World.
6. Make all the big or medium objects small, and the small objects big.
7. With these changes in the world, the English sentences
   1, 3, 4, and 10 become false, while the rest remain true.
8. Verify that the same holds for your translations.
9. If not, correct your translations.
10. Next, rotate your modified Wittgenstein’s World 90◦ clockwise (R, right).
11. Now sentences 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11 should be the only true ones that remain.
12. Let’s check your translations in another world. Run `run08b` for Boole's World.
13. The only English sentences that are true in this world are sentences 6 and 11.
14. Verify that all of your translations except 6 and 11 are false.
15. If not, correct your translations.
16. Now modify Boole’s World by exchanging the positions of b and c.
17. With this change, the English sentences 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11 come out true,
    while the rest are false.
18. Check that the same is true of your translations.
