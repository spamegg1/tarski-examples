# 04 - Fixing some more expressions

- See `SchönfinkelSentences` and try running `runQ04`.
- Again, the expressions in this list are not well-formed sentences.
- Turn them into sentences, but this time, do it
  *only by adding quantifier symbols or variables, or both*.
- *Do not add any parentheses*.
- Run to make sure your results are sentences (no errors when evaluated).
- Save the corrected sentences.
