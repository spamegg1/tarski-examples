# Tarski examples

This is a companion repository to [Tarski](https://github.com/spamegg1/tarski).

## Usage

Clone this repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spamegg1/tarski-examples
```

then open the folder in your IDE (Visual Studio Code with Metals extension,
or IntelliJ with Scala plugin).

## Exercises

There are 79 examples in total. The first 28 are for Propositional Logic and
the last 51 are for First-Order Logic, getting more difficult as you progress.

For each, open the same numbered Scala file, e.g. for `01` open `01.scala`.

### 01 - Wittgenstein's World and Sentences

1. Run the world, observe the blocks and the atomic sentences.
2. Mentally assess the truth values of the sentences.
3. Click "Eval" to see the correct interpretation.
4. If your interpretation is wrong on any of them,
   try to figure out how your interpretation is different than the correct one.

## Work in progress

Stay tuned!
