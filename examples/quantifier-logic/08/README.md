# 08 - Fixing ungrammatical expressions

- Open `BozoSentences2` and `LeibnizWorld`.
- Most of the expressions in this file are not sentences.
- Some are not wffs, while others are wffs but not sentences.
- Read and assess each one.
- If it is not a wff, fix it.
- If it is not a sentence, adjust it so as to make it a
  true sentence with as little change as possible.
- If it is a false sentence, try to make it true, again
  with as little change as possible.
- See if you can capture the intent of the original expression.
- Save your list of sentences as Sentences 3.8.
