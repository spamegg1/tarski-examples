# 12 - Translating universal noun phrases

Universal noun phrases are those that begin with determiners like "every", "each",
and "all". These are usually translated with the universal quantifier.
Sometimes noun phrases beginning with "no" and with "any" are also
translated with the universal quantifier.

Start a new sentence file, and enter translations of the following
sentences. This time each translation will contain exactly one ∀ and no ∃.

1. All squares are small.
2. Each small square is to the right of a.
3. a is to the left of every circle.
4. Every medium triangle is in front of b.
5. Each square is either in front of b or in back of a.
6. Every square is to the right of a and to the left of b.
7. Everything between a and b is a square.
8. Everything smaller than a is a square.
9. All circles are not small.
  [Note: Most people find this sentence ambiguous.
  Can you find both readings?
  One starts with ∀, the other with ¬.
  Use the former, the one that means all the circles are either medium or large.]
10. No circle is small.
11. a does not adjoin everything.
  [Note: This sentence is ambiguous.
  We want you to interpret it as a denial of the claim that a adjoins everything.]
12. a does not adjoin anything.
  [Note: These last two sentences mean different things,
  though they can both be translated using ∀, ¬, and Adjoins.]
13. a is not to the right of any square.
14. (?) If something is a square, then it is not in the same column as either a or b.
  [Warning: While this sentence contains the noun
  phrase "something," it is actually making a universal claim, and so
  should be translated with ∀. You might first try to paraphrase it
  using the English phrase "every square."]
15. (?) Something is a square if and only if it is not in the same column as either a or b.

Now let’s check the translations in some worlds.

- Open Claire’s World.
- Check to see that all the English sentences are true in this world,
- then make sure the same holds of your translations.
- If you have made any mistakes, fix them.
- Adjust Claire’s World by moving a directly in front of c.
- With this change, the English sentences 2, 6, and 12–15 are false,
- while the rest are true.
- Make sure that the same holds of your translations.
- If not, try to figure out what is wrong and fix it.
- Next, open Wittgenstein’s World.
- Observe that the English sentences 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are true,
- but the rest are false. Check that the same holds for your translations.
- If not, try to fix them.
- Finally, open Venn’s World.
- English sentences 2, 4, 7, and 11–14 are true;
- does the same hold for your translations?
- When you are satisfied that your translations are correct,
- submit your sentence file.
