# 41 - Ambiguity

- Use Tarski’s World to create a new sentence file and
- use it to translate the following sentences into fol.
- Each of these sentences is ambiguous,
- so you should have two different translations of each.
- Put the two translations of sentence 1 in slots 1 and 2,
- the two translations of sentence 2 in slots 3 and 4, and so forth.

1. Every cube is between a pair of circles.
2. Every cube to the right of a circle is smaller than it is.
3. Cube a is not bigger than every circle.
4. No cube is to the left of some circle.
5. (At least) two cubes are between (at least) two circles.

- Now open Carroll’s World.
- Which of your sentences are true in this world?
- You should find that exactly one translation of each sentence is true.
- If not, you should correct one or both of your translations.
- Notice that if you had had the world in front of you when you did the translations,
  it would have been harder to see the ambiguity in the English sentences.
  The world would have provided a context that made one interpretation the natural one.
