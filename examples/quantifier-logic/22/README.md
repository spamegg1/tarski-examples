# 22 - Consequence

These two English sentences are consequences of the ten sentences in Buridan’s Sentences.

1. There are no squares.
2. There is exactly one big triangle.

Because of this, they must be true in any world in which Buridan’s
Sentences are all true. So of course they must be true in World 3.21, no
matter how you built it.

- Translate the two sentences, adding them to the list in Buridan’s Sentences.
- Name the expanded list Sentences 3.22.
- Verify that they are all true in World 3.21.
- Modify the world by adding a square.
- Try placing it at various locations and giving it various sizes
  to see what happens to the truth values of the sentences in your file.
- One or more of the original ten sentences will always be false,
  though different ones at different times.
- Find a world in which only one of the original ten sentences is false
  and name it World 3.22.1.
- Next, get rid of the square and add a second big triangle.
- Again, move it around and see what happens to the truth values of the sentences.
- Find a world in which only one of the original ten sentences is false
- and name it World 3.22.2.
