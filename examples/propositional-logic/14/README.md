# 14 - Checking your translations

1. Open `BolzanoWorld` by running `run14a`.
2. Notice that all the English sentences from example 12 are true in this world.
  Thus, if your translations are accurate, they will also be true in this world.
3. Check to see that they are.
4. If you made any mistakes, go back and fix them.
  Remember that even if one of your sentences comes out true in
  `BolzanoWorld`, it does not mean that it is a proper translation of
  the corresponding English sentence. If the translation is correct, it will
  have the same truth value as the English sentence in every world.
  So let's check your translations in some other worlds.
5. Open `WittgensteinWorld` by running `run14b`.
6. Here we see that the English sentences 3, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 are false,
7. while the rest are true.
8. Check to see that the same holds of your translations.
9. If not, correct your translations
10. (and make sure they are still true in `BolzanoWorld`).
11. Next open `LeibnizWorld` by running `run14c`.
12. Here half the English sentences are true (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21)
13. and half false (3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22).
14. Check to see that the same holds of your translations.
15. If not, correct your translations.
16. Finally, open `VennWorld` by running `run14d`.
17. In this world, all of the English sentences are false.
18. Check to see that the same holds of your translations and correct them if necessary.
