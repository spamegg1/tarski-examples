# 09 - Describing a world

- Take a look at [`ReichenbachWorld1`](reichenbach1.png).
- In `sentencesQ09` you will describe some features of this
  world using sentences of the simple Aristotelian forms.
- Check each of your sentences to see that it is indeed
  a sentence and is true in this world.

1. Use your first sentence to describe the size of all the triangles.
2. Use your second sentence to describe the size of all the squares.
3. Describe the tones of the triangles (there are two).
4. Describe the shapes of the red blocks (there are two).
5. Express the fact that no square is big.
6. Express the fact that no triangle is lime.
7. Notice that some circle is big. Express this fact.
8. Notice that some circle is neither big nor small. Express this.
9. Observe that some circle is not small. Express this.
10. Notice that some circle is small. Express this fact.
11. Observe that some circle is not big. Express this.
12. Express the observation that no triangle is big.
13. Use your last sentence to express the truism that
  every circle is either small, medium, or big.

- Now change the sizes of the objects in the following way:
  - make one of the squares big and red,
  - one of the triangles medium and lime, and
  - all the circles small.
- With these changes, the following should come out false:
  - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- If not, then you have made an error in describing the original world.
- Can you figure out what it is?
- Try making other changes and see if your sentences have the expected truth values.
