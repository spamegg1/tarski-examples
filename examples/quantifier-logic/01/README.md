# 1 - Evaluating sentences in a world

- Open `PeirceWorld` and `PeirceSentences1` by running `runq01a`.
  There are 20 sentences.
- Work through them, assessing their truth and playing the game when necessary.
- Make sure you understand why they have the truth values they do.
- After you understand each of the sentences,
  go back and make the false ones true by adding or deleting a negation sign.
- Save when the sentences all come out true in `PeirceWorld`.
- Repeat for `PeirceSentences2` by running `runq01b`.
