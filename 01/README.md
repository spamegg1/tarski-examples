# 01 - Wittgenstein's World and Sentences

1. Run the world `run01a`, but do not click "Eval" yet.
2. Observe the blocks and the atomic sentences.
3. Mentally assess the truth values of the sentences.
4. Now click "Eval" to see the correct interpretation.
5. If your interpretation is wrong on any of them,
   try to figure out how your interpretation is different than the correct one.
6. Change the world in different ways (move or resize blocks, change names etc.)
7. Play around as much as you want to understand the meanings of atomic sentences.
8. Repeat the same for `run01b`.
9. For example, what does `Adj` mean? In the original world it always comes out false.
10. Pay attention to the `Btw` predicate.
  It looks like `Btw(c, d, b)` should be true.
  But we require them to be on a precise (45 degrees) diagonal, for it to be true.
11. When you are finished, close the window and terminate the program.
