# 15 - Evaluating multiple quantifier sentences

- Open up `PeanoWorld` and `PeanoSentences1` by running `runQ15a`.
- The sentence file contains 17 assertions that Alex made about this world.
- Evaluate Alex's claims.
- If you have trouble with any, play the game (several times if necessary)
  until you see where you are going wrong.
- Then change each of Alex's false claims into a true claim.
- If you can make the sentence true by adding a clause of the form
  - `x != y`, or
  - `¬Loc(x,y)`, do so.
- Otherwise, see if you can turn the false claim into an interesting truth:
  don't just add a negation sign to the front of the sentence.
- Save your corrected list of sentences.
- Repeat for `PeanoSentences2` by running `runQ15b` which contains 17 more sentences.
