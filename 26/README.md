# 26 - Equivalences in the blocks language

In the blocks language used in Tarski's World there are a
number of equivalent ways of expressing some of the predicates.

- Look at `BernaysSentences`.
- You will find a list of atomic sentences,
  where every other sentence is left blank.
- In each blank, write a sentence that is equivalent to the sentence above
  it, but does not use the predicate used in that sentence.
  (In doing this, you may presuppose any general facts about Tarski's World, for
  example that blocks come in only three shapes.)
- If your answers are correct, the odd numbered sentences will have
  the same truth values as the even numbered sentences in every world.
- Check that they do in
  - `AckermannWorld`,
  - `BolzanoWorld`,
  - `BooleWorld`, and
  - `LeibnizWorld`.
- Save the modified `BernaysSentences`.
