# 32 - Sentences that need paraphrasing before translation

Some English sentences do not easily lend themselves to direct
translation using the step-by-step procedure discussed above. With
such sentences, however, it is often quite easy to come up with an
English paraphrase that is amenable to the procedure. Consider, for ex-
ample, If a freshman takes a logic class, then he or she must be smart.
The step-by-step procedure does not work here. But we can paraphrase
the sentences as Every freshman who takes a logic class must be smart,
and this is easily treated by the procedure.

Translate the following sentences by first giving a suitable English paraphrase.

1. Only large objects have nothing in front of them.
2. If a cube has something in front of it, then it’s small.
3. Every cube in back of a dodecahedron is also smaller than it.
    [Warning: This is an example of what is known as a “donkey”
    sentence, following a notorious example Every farmer who owns
    a donkey beats it. What makes such a sentence a bit tricky is the
    existential noun phrase in the relative clause which serves as the
    antecedent of the pronoun “it” in the verb phrase. This combi-
    nation in effect forces us to translate the existential noun phrase
    with a universal quantifier. First, the donkey sentence would be
    paraphrased as For every farmer and every donkey, if the farmer
    owns the donkey, then he beats it. This sentence clearly needs two
    universal quantifiers in its translation. Several of the sentences
    that follow in this and the next exercise are donkey sentences.]
4. If e is between two objects, then they are both small.
5. If a tetrahedron is between two objects, then they are both small.
