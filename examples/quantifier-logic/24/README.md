# 24 - Simple mixed quantifier sentences

- Open Hilbert’s Sentences and Peano’s World.
- Evaluate the sentences one by one, playing the game if an evaluation surprises you.
- Once you understand the sentences,
  modify the false ones by adding a single negation sign so that they come out true.
- The catch is that you aren’t allowed to add the negation sign
  to the front of the sentence!
- Add it to an atomic formula, if possible,
- and try to make the claim nonvacuously true.
- (This won’t always be possible.)
- Make sure you understand both why the original sentence is false
  and why your modified sentence is true.
- When you’re done, submit your sentence list with the changes.
