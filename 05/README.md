# 05 - Building a world

1. Run `run05` which starts with an empty world and `QuinnSentences`.
2. Build a single world where all the sentences in this file are `true`.
3. As you work through the sentences, you will find yourself successively modifying
  the world. Whenever you make a change in the world, be careful that
  you don’t make one of your earlier sentences `false`.
4. When you are finished, verify that all the sentences are really `true`.
