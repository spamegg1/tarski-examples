# 23 - Independence

Show that the following sentence is independent of those in Buridan’s Sentences,
that is, neither it nor its negation is a consequence of those sentences.
`∃x ∃y (x != y ∧ Tri(x) ∧ Tri(y) ∧ Mid(x) ∧ Mid(y))`
You will do this by building two worlds, one in which this sentence is
false (call this World 3.23.1) and one in which it is true (World 3.23.2)
but both of which make all of Buridan’s sentences true.
