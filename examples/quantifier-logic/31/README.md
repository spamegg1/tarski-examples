scratch. You should try to use the step-by-step procedure.
Start a new sentence file and translate the following English sentences.

2. No dodecahedron has anything in back of it.
3. No tetrahedron is the same size as any cube.
4. Every dodecahedron is the same size as some cube.
5. Anything between two dodecahedra is a cube. [Note: This use of
  two really can be paraphrased using between a dodecahedron and
  a dodecahedron.]
6. Every cube falls between two objects.
7. Every cube with something in back of it is small.
8. Every dodecahedron with nothing to its right is small.
9. (?) Every dodecahedron with nothing to its right has something to its left.
