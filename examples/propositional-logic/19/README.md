# 19 - DeMorgan Equivalences

- Run `run19a` to see `DeMorganSentences`.
- Construct a world where sentences 1,3,5,7 are true.
- Notice that no matter how you do this,
  the sentences 2,4,6,8 also come out true.
- Write down your world in `grid19a`.
- Next build a world where sentences 1,3,5,7 are false and run it in `run19b`.
- Notice that no matter how you do it,
  the sentences 2,4,6,8 also come out false.
- Write down this world in `grid19b`.
