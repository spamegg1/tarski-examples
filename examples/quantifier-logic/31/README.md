2. No circle has anything above it.
3. No triangle is the same size as any cube.
4. Every circle is the same size as some cube.
5. Anything between two circles is a cube. [Note: This use of
  two really can be paraphrased using between a circle and
  a circle.]
6. Every cube falls between two objects.
7. Every cube with something above it is small.
8. Every circle with nothing to its right is small.
9. (?) Every circle with nothing to its right has something to its left.
10. Any circle to the left of a cube is big.
