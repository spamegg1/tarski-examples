# 40 - Translating extended discourse

The problems of translation are much more difficult when we look at extended discourse,
where more than one sentence comes in.
This example will help you get a feeling for the difficulty.

- Open Reichenbach’s World 1 and examine it.
- Check to see that all of the following discourse is true in this world.

    > There are (at least) two cubes. There is something between them.
    > It is a medium circle. It is in front of a big circle.
    > These two are left of a small circle. There are two triangles.

- Translate this discourse into a single first-order sentence.
- Check to see that your translation is true.
- Now check to see that your translation is false in Reichenbach’s World 2.
- Open Reichenbach’s World 2.
- Check to see that all of the following discourse is true in this world.

    > There are two triangles. There is something between them.
    > It is a medium circle. It is in front of a big circle.
    > There are two cubes. These two are left of a small circle.

- Translate this into a single first-order sentence.
- Check to see that your translation is true.
- Now check to see that your translation is false in Reichenbach’s World 1.
- However, note that the English sentences in the two discourses are in fact
  exactly the same; they have just been rearranged!
- The moral of this example is that the correct translation of a sentence
- into first-order logic (or any other language) can be very dependent on context.
- Submit your sentence file.
