# 1 - Evaluating sentences in a world

Open `PeirceWorld` and `PeirceSentences` by running.
There are 30 sentences in this file.
Work through them, assessing their truth and playing the game when necessary.
Make sure you understand why they have the truth values they do.
After you understand each of the sentences,
go back and make the false ones true by adding or deleting a negation sign.
Save when the sentences all come out true in `PeirceWorld`.
