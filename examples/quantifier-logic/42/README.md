# 42 - Block parties

The interaction of quantifiers and negation gives
rise to subtleties that can be pretty confusing.

- Open Löwenheim’s Sentences, which contains eight sentences divided into two sets.
- Suppose we imagine a column containing blocks to be a party and
- think of the blocks in the column as the attendees.
- We’ll say a party is lonely if there’s only one block attending it,
- and say a party is exclusive if there’s any block who’s not there
  (i.e., who’s in another column).

1. Using this terminology, give simple and clear English renditions of
  each of the sentences. For example, sentence 2 says some of the
  parties are not lonely, and sentence 7 says there’s only one party.
  You’ll find sentences 4 and 9 the hardest to understand. Construct
  a lot of worlds to see what they mean.
2. With the exception of 4 and 9, all of the sentences are equivalent
  to other sentences on the list, or to negations of other sentences (or
  both). Which sentences are 3 and 5 equivalent to? Which sentences
  do 3 and 5 negate?
3. Sentences 4 and 9 are logically independent: it’s possible for the two
  to have any pattern of truth values. Construct four worlds: one in
  which both are true (World 3.42.1), one in which 4 is true and 9 false
  (World 3.42.2), one in which 4 is false and 9 true (World 3.42.3), and
  one in which both are false (World 3.42.4).
