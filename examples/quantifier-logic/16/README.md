# 16 - Building a world

- Open Ramsey’s Sentences.
- Build a world in which sentences 1–10 are all true at once.
- These sentences all make either “particular” claims
- (that is, they contain no quantifiers)
- or “existential” claims (that is, they assert that things of a certain sort exist).
- Consequently, you could make them true by successively adding objects to the world.
- But part of the example is to make them all true with as few objects as possible.
- You should be able to do it with six objects, total.
- So rather than adding objects for each new sentence,
- try adjusting the world, and only add new objects when necessary.
- Again, be sure to go back and check that all the sentences are true
  when you are finished.
- Save your world as World 3.16.

[Hint: To make all the sentences true with this small a world,
one of the objects will have to have two names.]
