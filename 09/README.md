# 09 - Evaluating sentences in a world

1. Run `run09` and go through `AbelardSentences` in `WittgensteinWorld`.
2. Evaluate them yourself first, with pen and paper, then "Eval" to compare your results.
3. If you make a mistake, play the game to see where you have gone wrong.
4. Close the program.
5. Edit the false sentences: change one or more names used in them to make them true.
6. Save sentences, and re-run to see that they are all true.
