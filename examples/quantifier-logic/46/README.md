# 46 - Describing a world

- Let’s try our hand describing a world using multiple quantifiers.
- Open Finsler’s World and start a new sentence file.

1. Notice that all the small blocks are in front of all the big blocks.
  Use your first sentence to say this.
2. With your second sentence, point out that there’s a
  cube that is bigger than a triangle.
3. Next, say that all the cubes are in the same column.
4. Notice, however, that this is not true of the triangles. So write the
  same sentence about the triangles, but put a negation sign out front.
5. Every cube is also in a different row from every other cube. Say this.
6. Again, this isn’t true of the triangles, so say that it’s not.
7. Notice there are non-identical triangles that are the same size. Express
this fact.
8. But there aren’t non-identical cubes of the same size, so say that, too.

- Are all your translations true in Finsler’s World?
- If not, try to figure out why.
- In fact, play around with the world and see if your first-order sentences
  always have the same truth values as the claims you meant to express.
- Check them out in König’s World, where all of the original claims are false.
- Are your sentences all false? When you think you’ve got them right,
- submit your sentence file.
