# 04 - Basic Propositional Logic

1. Run `run04`, which will evaluate `BooleSentences` in `WittgensteinWorld`.
2. Go through the sentences and mentally assess their truth values.
3. Make sure you understand why a sentence has the truth value it does,
  before you go to the next.
4. Do you see the importance of parentheses?
5. Make sure you understand why the 1st and 2nd sentences have different truth values.
6. Make sure you understand why the 3rd and 4th sentences have different truth values.
7. Predict whether the 7th sentence will have the same truth value as 8 or as 9.
8. Predict whether the 10th sentence will have the same truth value as 8 or as 9.
9. After you understand all of the sentences, go back and see which of
  the false sentences you can make true by adding, deleting or moving
  parentheses but without making any other changes.
