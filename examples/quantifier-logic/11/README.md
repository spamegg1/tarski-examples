# 11 - Common mistakes, part 2

- In this example we return to the point made in example q06.
- Glance back at that example to recall the basic point.
- Now see `AllanSentences`.
- In these sentences, 1 and 4 are the correct translations of
  - Some circle is big
  - All triangles are small.
- Let's investigate the logical relations between these and sentences 2 and 3.
- Construct a world `worldQ11` and run `runQ11`, in which:
  - sentences 2 and 4 are true, but
  - sentences 1 and 3 are false.
  - This shows that sentence 1 is not a consequence of 2, and
  - sentence 3 is not a consequence of 4.
- Can you change the world in such a way so that:
  - sentence 3 is true, and
  - sentence 4 is false?
  - If so, change the world and evaluate to verify it.
  - If not, explain why you can't and what this shows.
- Can you change the world in such a way, so that:
  - sentence 1 is true, and
  - sentence 2 is false?
  - If so, do so and evaluate to verify it.
  - If not, explain why not.
