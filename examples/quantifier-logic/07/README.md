# 07 - Fixing ungrammatical expressions

- Open `BozoSentences1` and `LeibnizWorld`.
- Some of the expressions are not wffs, some are wffs but not sentences,
- and one is a sentence but false.
- Read and assess each one.
- See if you can adjust each one to make it a true sentence
- with as little change as possible.
- Try to capture the intent of the original expression,
- if you can tell what that was (if not, don't worry).
- Evaluate to make sure your results are true sentences and then save your file.
